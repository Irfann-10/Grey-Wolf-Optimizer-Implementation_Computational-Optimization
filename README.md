# Grey-Wolf-Optimizer-Implementation_Computational-Optimization
## Multi-Function Benchmark Testing and Performance Analysis
Conducted by: Dr. Eng. Rafał Brociek, Assistant Professor, Faculty of Applied Mathematics, Silesian University of Technology, Poland

• Implemented Grey Wolf Optimizer in Mathematica for three benchmark optimization functions: Sphere, Rastrigin, and Rosenbrock

• Conducted systematic performance evaluation across multiple dimensions (2, 5, 10), population sizes (10, 20, 50, 100), and iteration counts (10, 30, 50)

• Generated comprehensive datasets with 36 test configurations per function, demonstrating algorithm convergence behavior

• Created dynamic visualizations and animations showing fitness evolution across different parameter combinations

• Achieved optimal solutions with fitness values approaching zero (10⁻³⁹ for Sphere function), demonstrating algorithm effectiveness

• Developed modular code architecture with separate functions for wolf classification, fitness evaluation, and boundary constraint management
